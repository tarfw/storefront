# Final Storefront Architecture Plan

## Overview
A billion-tenant scalable storefront using Cloudflare Workers, KV for static data, Instant DB for dynamic/realtime data with local-first architecture, and Turso for RAG/vector data. Includes an AI chat system for enhanced user experience.

## Components
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Server-side rendering and API logic.
- **Cloudflare KV**: Static content (domain mappings, landing pages up to 20KB with SEO, sections, configs).
- **Instant DB**: Dynamic data (products, carts) with realtime subscriptions and local-first sync for instant browser loads.
- **Turso**: Vector database for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with cheap vector reads; powers AI chat system for product recommendations, search, and conversations.
- **Custom Domains**: Handled via Cloudflare Custom Hostnames + KV mappings.

## Data Storage
- **KV Keys**:
  - `domain:{domain}` â†’ JSON with tenant_id and full landing content.
- **Instant DB Tables**:
  - `tenants`, `products`, `carts` (realtime-enabled for carts).
- **Turso Tables**:
  - Vector embeddings for products/content (e.g., for AI search/recommendations).

## Request Flow
1. User visits subdomain/custom domain.
2. Worker fetches KV for static content.
3. Queries Instant DB for dynamic data (products/carts).
4. For AI chat/RAG: Queries Turso for vector similarity searches.
5. Browser uses local-first Instant DB for instant loads/realtime updates; AI chat integrates for personalized interactions.

## Scaling
- KV: Edge-cached, handles 1B entries.
- Instant DB: Global, realtime, local-first for speed.
- Turso: Efficient vector reads for AI at scale.
- No sharding needed initially; auto-scales.

## Benefits
- Fast (local-first): Instant loads, realtime carts.
- AI-Powered: RAG via Turso for smart chat/recommendations.
- Cost-Effective: KV reads + Instant DB storage-only + Turso's cheap vectors.
- Scalable: Billion tenants via edge + realtime DB + vector search.

## Next Steps
- Set up Instant DB and Turso.
- Migrate data to KV/Instant DB/Turso.
- Implement Workers code for AI integration.
- Add realtime cart features and AI chat system.
- Test and deploy.
